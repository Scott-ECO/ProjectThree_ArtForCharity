# ProjectThree_ArtForCharity
ASU FinTech Bootcamp - Project Three

We've created a program that helps charities who assist endangered species by selling NFT's and then forwarding the proceeds to those charities. Our users are given a choice of different species that they can sponsor with their NFT purchases. Once a species is selected, the user is presented with current data about the plight of that species, including their current population, habitat, reasons why ther are endangered and the effects of climate change on their population.
